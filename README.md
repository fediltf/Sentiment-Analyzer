## Overview

The project focuses on sentiment analysis using NLTK, featuring both VADER sentiment scoring and a RoBERTa pretrained model. It includes a comprehensive comparison between these models, showcasing different approaches to sentiment analysis techniques.

## Tech Stack

- **Python Libraries:** NLTK, Transformers (for RoBERTa)
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your local development environment:

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional but recommended)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sentiment-analyzer.git
   ```
   
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```sh
   cd sentiment-analyzer
   ```

3. **Set up the environment:**
   - Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
     ```sh
     python -m venv env
     source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
     ```

   - Install the required dependencies:
     ```sh
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

4. **Explore the notebooks:**
   - Use Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab to open and run the provided notebooks. Start with `vader_analysis.ipynb` for VADER sentiment scoring and `roberta_analysis.ipynb` for using the RoBERTa pretrained model.

## Usage

To start using the project, open and run the notebooks in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab. Follow the instructions within each notebook to perform sentiment analysis using VADER and RoBERTa models, and to explore the comparison between these techniques.
